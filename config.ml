Usage: "^(Filename.basename (Sys.argv.(0)))^" file1 file2 [options] 

Takes as input two gff version 2 files, the first one with transcript structures to assess and the second 
one with reference transcript structures against which to do this assessment (only exon rows will be considered
but they have to contain transcript_id in column 11 and its value in column 12 otherwise it will exit). 
This program will only assess stranded spliced transcripts coming from the first file. It will output 
a three column tsv file where the first column is the assessed transcript id, the second column is its 
class with respect to file2 transcripts, and the third column is a comma separated list of file2 transcript ids 
corresponding to the assessed transcript.
The output classes are the following and are chosen in the following order in case of multiple possible assignments:
- Unstranded: the assessed transcript is unstranded,
- Monoexonic: the assessed transcript is mono-exonic,
- Intergenic_or_antisense: the assessed transcript is stranded and spliced but does not strandedly overlap any reference transcript,
- Exact: there is a reference transcript with all its introns equal to the assessed transcript and reciprocally,
- Extension: there is a reference transcript with all its introns equal to the assessed transcript but the assessed
  transcript has additional introns,
- Inclusion: there is a reference transcript with a subset of introns corresponding to all introns of the assessed transcript,
- Overlap: there is a reference transcript overlapped by the assessed transcript,

** file1 and file2 must be provided in gff version 2 format and should contain exon rows (with transcript_id in field no 12).
** [options] can be:
   -o outfile:    outfile is the name of the gff file the user wants the output to be provided in. 
                  -> default is file1_comp.tsv.

   -v:            provides the output result in the standard output rather than in an output file.
                  -> default is unset.
   
   -s nbseq:      nbseq is an upper bound for the number of sequences you have in your input gff files.
                  -> default is 50.

   -so:           comptr does not require the input file to be sorted, however this option enables to skip
                  the input file sorting in case this file is already sorted according to strand, chromosome, start, end. 
                  Note: this sorting could be performed outside compmerge using the unix sort command: 
                  sort -k7,7 -k1,1 -k4,4n -k5,5n file > sortedfile
