- when a file is empty give a more explicit message than
  Fatal error: exception Failure("hd")

- when a file is ill formatted say which one
# Incorrectly formatted gtf file with not even 3 fields separated by tabs!

- allow comment lines in gff files

- the files are sorted multiple times and maybe some sorts could be avoided
for example it is first sorted and then we use a hashtable to put the tr inside
and we make a tr list out of it and then we sort...
